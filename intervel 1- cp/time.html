            If I had more time I would organize more and add more decoration.
            For example, I would add more images and code to make the page look clean. I could
            add borders for the images and text so they could be divided.I could also organize my navbar to make it more intertaining to look at. For images I could add more example of my work 
            and some fun images to make the page fun the read through. I would also try to learn new ways to add organized info to the page.
            Try to make the page look like one you would see on the internet like facebook, or youtube. My code for the page is on the left. </font>
