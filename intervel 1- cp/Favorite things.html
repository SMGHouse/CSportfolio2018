    <h1>Favorite Things</h1>

    <p>The two games that I play the most are Fortnite and C.O.D.
    Fortnite is a game were you can fight in a lobby <br>full of 100 people around the world and try to be the last one standing.<br>
    You can buy cosmetic items for money and look good while you play.<br> 
    You can play with one more friend or in a squad of four. There is another mode called Save the World.<br>
    In there you fight a storm the spawns zombies that you have to kill or defend from. <br>
    It's a fun game with a great story that keeps me busy. C.O.D is a simple shooter game.<br>
    make a class to fight with and there are many different modes you can play with people online.<br></p>

    <p>Food has been apart of my life since I was born I would eat as much I could until I got a stomachache.<br>
    When I eat I don't usually worry about  the things in my life. My favorite foods are pizza and peanut butter.<br>
    I know its bad to eat too much of any of those things but I love the flavor.<br></p>
