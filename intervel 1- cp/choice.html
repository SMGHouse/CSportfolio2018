            Most of my choices were made to make my webpage seem unique and formal so people can see my skill with HTML and CSS.
            Some choices I made were to add images to my webpage to help strengthen my knowledge on how to do so and make
            the page more decrative. I also added a
            GIF to the background to also help me practice how to use CSS and also add uniqueness to the page. 
            Adding boxes around paragraphs and images to make the webpage more formal. I also added a navbar so the webpage would seem organize and so
            readers can see by knowledge of HTML and CSS.
