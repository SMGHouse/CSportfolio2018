                Shasta Summit is my schoola dn we recently got a knew campus. 
                Its bigger than the old one, and we have better classrooms. This is my sophomore year
                so I got to see all my firends from last year. I have new classes now with spanish two and physics. 
                Its the star of a new school year so we start with expiditions. So far I have a lot of fun
                in Intro to Phycology, and Pogramming. Both these classes are UC approved so it's
                grade will show on my college transcript. What will also be on my 
                college transcript will be my hours for volunteering at a summer camp. 
                I have spent three of my summers there and have accumulated at least 400 hours will
                is sure to look good.
