            The two games that I play the most are Fortnite and C.O.D.
    Fortnite is a game were you can fight in a lobby full of 100 people around the world and try to be the last one standing.
    You can buy cosmetic items for money and look good while you play.
    You can play with one more friend or in a squad of four. There is another mode called Save the World.
    In there you fight a storm that spawns zombies that you have to kill or defend from. 
    It's a fun game with a great story that keeps me busy. C.O.D is a simple, first-person shooter game.
    You can make a class to fight with, and there are many different modes you can play with people online.
