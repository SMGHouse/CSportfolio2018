                <h1>What I Have Learned To Understand</h1>
                <strong>
<p>
    Thanks to the second interval, my understanding of coding has widen now that I know more about Java Script.
    I have learned how to add circles using ellipses. I now also understand how to use variables more often to make coding easier. 
    I also know how to change the appearance of circles, with the key words, fill, stroke, and strokeweight.
    I know how to move the circle, and create patterns with them by changing the y and x variables.
    How to add if statements so that I can set conditions to my webpages.
    I have also learned how to make an ellipse follow the mouse on the page. 
    This interval has also helped me practice making ellipses more complicated than just making circles. 
    How to add loops to my coding. I learned how to place a circle in a loop by going to the loop function where I increase i and changed it to increase by my chosen radius instead of just one. 
    I learned how to put loops inside of others and make a vertical loop and a horizontal loop with a circle. 
    I also learned how to make a circleâ€™s color, outline, and shape in a pattern.
    How to use functions to make art. I also learned to make an image appear when you click on the page. 
    I learned that there are two ways to make functions and how to use them. I learned how to name functions and use them to have a user interface.
