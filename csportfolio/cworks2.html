                <strong>
<p>
    Some specifics for the code that I have learned are how to make circles, loops, if statments/conditionals, and functions. I have also learned how to make
    a webpage user interactive.

            <font size="6"><strong> Ellipses </strong><br>
            Ellipses are a basic code that you can use to make circles on your webpage. The first line in the code is color of the circle and the numbers in the 
            parentheses are how you can code the color. The first number is for red, the second is green, and the thrid codes for blue. You can change 
            those number to get any color and,(0,0,0) codes for the color black. For the second line of code, that is to control the size of the the outline
            of the circle. The third color is to code for the color of the outlie. The numbers follow to same rules as the code on the first line, only the code,
            (255,255,255) codes for white. The fourth line codes for the actual circle. The first number in the parentheses code for the x-axis where the
            circle is positioned. The second number codes for the y-axis poisition of the circle. The third number is the width of the circle, and the fourth 
            is the length of the circle.

        <p style="width:50%"> 
            <font size="6"><strong> Loops </strong><br>
            The first line of code makes circles appear in a horizontal line. The first circle starts at the 0 position on the x-axis, and duplicates itself by 
            30 units form 0 until it reaches the width of the webpage. The i is there to make a varible so that the x position of the circle will duplicate.
            The second line of code is to make circles appear in a vertical line. The first 
            circle starts at the 0 position on the y-axis, and duplicates itself by 30 units form 0 as well. The duplication stops when it reaches the 
            length of the webpage. The j is also a vairble used to change the y poistion of the duplicated circles. The last line just codes for the circle 
            and the i and j are there so that the loops can work on that specific circle.

            <font size="6"><strong> If Statements/Contionals </strong><br>
           This is a pretty simple code. An if statement can make condions to your page and make different things happen. For this code, 
           the first line codes for the condition for if the mouse is less that 200 on the y-axis. The next three lines code for a circle 
           that is red and has a red outline with a thickness of 5. Together, the code says that if the mouse is less than
           200 on the y-axis, then a red circle should appear. For the line with else, that codes for a blue circle with a blue outline with an outline
           thickness of 5. With all the code together, if the mouse is less than 200 on the y-axis, a red circle will appear and if the mouse is not less
           than 200, then a blue circle will appear.

            <font size="6"><strong> Functions </strong><br>
            A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 
            To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
            This function's name is the kirby function, which states that in the first line.
            The code for ellipses in the kirby function are used to make that face that you see in the background.
            Now that the kirby function has the task of making a kirby face.
            For the mouseClicked function under the kirby function, that function is there to make the kirby function create a kirby face
            in the x and y positions where you clicked your mouse.
