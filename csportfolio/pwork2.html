                <strong>
<p>
Over the second interval, I have made projects that have let my practice my ability to make new kind of code, and practice how to code in Java Script.
For this How To page, It has let my express and practice how to explain and show how I used my code.<br>
Throughout different checkpoints;
The checkpoints have helped me practice and get to know how to use variables, javascript, and ellipses. The project has also helped me learn how to move those ellipses and widen my knowledge on how to code.<br>
The checkpoints helped me understand how to use if statements so I can make conditions to my pages, and explain them.<br>  
The checkpoints also helped me understand, explain, and learn how to use loop commands.<br>
And the checkpoints have help my how to use functions to make are and how to explain how I coded those functions.
