<p>
    I have created a webpage that lets me experess what I have learned during the second interval for expositons.
    The area inside the changing border color is a js file that I made that combined loops, functions, and if statments.
    There is also user interaction. To specify, the loop is made to change the pattern the border makes with different shades of purple.
    The function is to make an image show when you click in the area. The if statement is to make a kirby face appear when you click on the left side, and a meta knight 
    face appear when you click on the right side.
    Throughout this interval, I created patterns using ellipses.
    I got to create a page that let me make patterns with circles by using my mouse.
    I created a page with changing circles with the loop command.
    And I got to created a page where you can interact by clicking on the page.
