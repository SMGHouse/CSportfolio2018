                <strong>
<p>
Throughout the projects I have many choices to make the page either look appeasing or having lots of context. I also have tried to make 
any checkpoints more detailed and have more explanation. 
Some specific choices I have made are like my decideing to make a image using circles that looks like Kirby because I wanted to add some of my interests into to the code.
I would also want to have tried to make a more clear and cool pattern.
I would try to make the patterns you are able to make more organized and add more if statements to add more possible pattern. 
I also would want to add more patterns of circles by making more ellipses and making them move in different directions. 
All of these choices I have made to make my page more interesting so that I can acheive a better grade.
