<p>
    If I were to have more time, I would try to make a checkpoints more presentable so that I could practice perfecting my webpages. 
    I would try to make each checkpoint more discriptive, creative, and try to add some of my own knowledge instead of following instructions. 
    I would want to do this to practice Java Script more so that I can code more efficiently. I feel that my skill is only decent because I can understand
    how to code basic things like paragraphs and ellipses, but I still have to reference to places like W3 Schools, friends, and Mr.Hesby.
    I would want to learn to become exceptional to the point I can make projects personal, and academic ones in a couple of hours. 
    I want to be able to not forget basic coding and have to waste time and search it up. If I more time I would practice how to enforce 
    my knowledge about each function or statement and how it works.
