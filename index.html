            I am a student at Summit Shasta and I'm a sophomore. I have thirteen cousins, and six uncles and aunts.
            I also have a sister and I live with my mom and here partner, Scott. He has his own children that come spent time with us on the weekends. 
            Some of my hobbies are playing video games, or creative building wether onilne or with legos. Some of my 
            favorite things are the color yellow, food, my family, and video games, specifically Fortnite and C.O.D..</font>
